###  Transaction Summary Snap
A malicious dapp can misguide users with its front end. For example, a buy button can withdraw all funds. In such a situation, the transaction snap will give a summary of the exact details of what the transaction will do with the userâ€™s funds. As the name suggests, it shows the entire transaction summary of the upcoming transaction before signing the actual transaction in simple understandable language. This snap provides the user with an AI generated summary for the transaction they are currently performing. This snap provides the contract source code and the function the user is interacting with OpenAI's GPT engine, that generates an user-friendly insight for the ongoing transaction.
