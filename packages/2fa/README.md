###  Two Factor Authentication (2FA) Snap
This snap brings in an additional layer of security to metamask. Losing the private key of the account should not be the reason for anyone lossing all assets hence this feature provides the much needed layer that saves users even after lossing the key. The snap utilises a time-based one-time password (TOTP) which is a temporary passcode generated by an algorithm that uses the current time of day as one of its authentication factors. The user gets this one time password (TOTP) on his favorite Authenticator mobile app on initiating a transaction. A secret is generated using a one-way function and is passed on to generate the TOTP. This TOTP is same accross all the authenticator apps and the user can use any authenticator mobile application of his choice to genrate the TOTP. The transaction can only be signed upon providing the correct TOTP. On each transaction initiation, the snap prompts up the user to enter the TOTP using the *snap_dialogue* which is then verified using some algorithms. If the code is verified, the user can sign the transaction. However, the transaction would not be proceeded if the code fails verification.
