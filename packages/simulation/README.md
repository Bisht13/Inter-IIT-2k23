###  Transaction Simulation Snap
This snap enables the user to simulate the initiated transaction (using Tenderly's API) before signing. By simulation, a user can actually see the results of the transaction without sending them on-chain. This creates an environment where in case the transaction is going to fail, the user gets an idea beforehand about the failure and the errors that the transaction may encounter. If the transaction is going to succeed, the user gets a track of the final results.
