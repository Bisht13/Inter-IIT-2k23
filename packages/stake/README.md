###  Staking/ Unstaking Snap
Many of the crypto users have their funds in their wallet and recieve their payment in crypto. There can be cases when the user wishes to stake a part of their salary or funds in a periodic manner. Using this snap, we bring in this user convenience, a user can set the protocol, percentage of his funds, he/she want to stake periodically, the period of which is also set by the user. As soon as the user's address receives the payroll, after the set duration, there will be a metamask notification showing the same and will ask for approval of the transaction of the percantage set of assets from his/her account .
The periodic notification will be sent using metamask cron-job so that users dont have to keep a track of the incoming assets and staking them manualy to the DEXs .
