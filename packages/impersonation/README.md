###  Impersonation Snap
There are scenarios when users want to look for someone else's address positions on snap to get an idea of which and how much assets are being holded by that address. This snap allows the user to view the position of any other userâ€™s address in DeFi protocols like AAVE, Compound etc. In future, we plan to add a virtual playground for users which allows them to play around with someone else's postions in a forked environment.
