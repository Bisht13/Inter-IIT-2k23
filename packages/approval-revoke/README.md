###  Smart Contract Approval/Revoke Snap
This snap allows the user to fetch the smart contracts which have been approved by him for dealing with his ERC20 tokens. Any time the user can see the tokens, the spender and the allowance provided to them. This saves users from interacting with any pirated site (linked to a contract) that he/she might have interacted by unknowingly. This snap also allows users to revoke approval to any spender smart contract that was approved earlier.
